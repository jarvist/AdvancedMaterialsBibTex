AdvancedMaterialsBibTex
=======================

Advanced Materials BibTex files. Generated in 2010. No promises that these are useful!

Originally description from my defunct Posterous blog:
"Most assuredly not perfect, but worked sufficiently for me.

Made from makebst (see attached log), then hand tweaked. 
I may have also done evil things such as delete fields in the 
bibliography files to stop the output of extraneous information, 
whereas the more elegant thing would be to change the .bst style file 
to simply not display it even if available."

I then had to mangle the paper into Word format, I think I used this workflow:
